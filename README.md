# Neon Shadow videogame-prototipe

This repository is going to be used for the development of a multiplataform 3d game. The game will be created on unity and we are going to use maya to model some of the resources of the game.

The player is going to be capable of move around the map, jump, jump between walls, dive and fight.

The enemies are going to be diverse, but small hordes, bosses and dark minions.

## Concept
The game is going to be a combat multiplatform 3d game. The game is it going to be located on a neon Japanese city with some futuristic details.
