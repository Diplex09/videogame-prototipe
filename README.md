# Neon Shadows
is a third-person action platformer with hack-and-slash style combat made in Unity. The game will be set in a Japanese city with some futuristic details and a cyberpunk touch with neon colors. We took inspiration from Neon Abyss, Katana ZERO, and Far Cry New Dawn for the design, and Super Mario 64, Psychonauts 2, and A Hat in Time for the gameplay.

# Multiplayer
Neon Shadows includes a prototype multiplayer component developed using Photon Fusion. While this was not designed to be a core mechanic in our game, it will showcase a potential new gameplay mode as well as our ability to achieve multiplayer networking.
